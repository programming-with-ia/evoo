# @evoo/cli

Welcome to the Evoo CLI, a powerful and extensible command-line interface designed to streamline your development workflow. This tool is built with a plugin-first architecture, allowing you to customize and enhance its functionality to meet the specific needs of your projects.

## Features

- **Plugin-Driven**: The CLI's functionality is extended through plugins, making it highly modular and adaptable.
- **Interactive Prompts**: An intuitive and interactive experience guides you through the available options and commands.
- **Monorepo-Aware**: The CLI is designed to work seamlessly in monorepo environments, with intelligent context detection.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Evoo CLI, you can install it globally or as a local dependency in your project.

## Usage

Once installed, you can run the CLI using the `evoo` command. The CLI will guide you through the available jobs and plugins, allowing you to select the tasks you want to perform.

## Plugin Development

The true power of the Evoo CLI lies in its plugin system. If you are interested in creating your own plugins, please refer to the [Plugin Development Guide](../core/README.md) in the `@evoo/core` package for detailed documentation and best practices.
