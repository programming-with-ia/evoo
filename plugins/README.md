# Evoo CLI Plugins

This directory serves as a central hub for all plugins developed for the Evoo CLI, including both official packages and contributions from the community. Plugins are the primary mechanism for extending the functionality of the CLI, allowing for a highly modular and customizable experience.

## Official Plugins

Below is a curated list of official plugins maintained by the Evoo team. Each plugin is designed to address a specific set of needs and can be easily integrated into your workflow.

- **[Executor](./evoo-plugin-exec/README.md)**: A versatile plugin that allows you to run shell commands as part of your CLI jobs.
- **[Goodbye](./goodbye/README.md)**: A simple, illustrative plugin that demonstrates the basic structure of a plugin.
- **[Placeholder](./placeholder/README.md)**: A template plugin that serves as a starting point for creating your own plugins.
- **[Shadcn](./shadcn/README.md)**: A powerful plugin for integrating with the Shadcn UI component library.

## Third-Party Plugins

The Evoo CLI ecosystem is designed to be open and extensible, and we encourage the community to build and share their own plugins. If you have developed a plugin that you would like to share, please feel free to add it to this list.

To contribute, simply open a pull request and add a link to your plugin's documentation in this section. We look forward to seeing what you build!
